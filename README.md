# 🚦 RoadSafe Analytics: Road Accidents – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Statement

* Analyze a large dataset of road accidents.
* Identify trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accident severity.
* Perform in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python libraries.
* Extract insights to support **road safety awareness and policy-making**.

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

* Handle and preprocess real-world accident data.
* Explore accident frequency by **time, location, weather, and road conditions**.
* Visualize accident severity patterns using plots and graphs.
* Derive actionable insights for **safety recommendations**.
* Document findings with **reports and presentations**.

### 🟡 Milestone 2

**Week 3 – Univariate Analysis**

* Distribution of accident severity levels.
* Frequency by time, weekday, and month.
* Common weather & road conditions.
* Visuals: histograms, pie charts, bar graphs.

**Week 4 – Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**

* Severity correlation with:

  * Weather
  * Visibility
  * Road surface condition
  * Traffic congestion
* Visuals: heatmaps, boxplots, pair plots.

---

### 🔵 Milestone 3

**Week 5 – Geospatial & Location-Based Analysis**

* Visualize accident hotspots (lat/long).
* Scatter/density maps for states & cities.
* Identify top 5 accident-prone states/cities.

**Week 6 – Insight Extraction & Hypothesis Testing**

* Key questions:

  * When do most accidents occur?
  * Are accidents more severe in rain/fog?
  * Correlation between visibility & severity?
* Document assumptions and test hypotheses.

---

### 🔴 Milestone 4

**Week 7 – Final Visualization & Interpretation**

* Combine findings into clear summaries.
* Storytelling with visuals.
* Finalize all graphs and interpretations.

**Week 8 – Documentation & Presentation**

* Compile methodology, insights, conclusions.
* Prepare final presentation with charts.
* Practice presenting and Q\&A.
