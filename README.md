DV-RoadSafe Analytics 🚦
📌 Project Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze a large dataset of road accidents to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accident severity. The project involves performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract meaningful insights that can help improve road safety.

🎯 Outcomes

Understand how to handle and preprocess real-world accident data.

Explore accident frequency based on time, location, weather, and road conditions.

Visualize patterns in accident severity using various plots and graphs.

Derive insights to support road safety awareness and policy recommendations.

Prepare detailed documentation and presentation of findings and results.

Milestone 1
Week 1: Project Initialization and Dataset Acquisition

Define project objectives and expected outcomes.

Download the US Accidents dataset.

Explore the structure, shape, and schema of the dataset.

Check for missing data, data types, and basic statistics.

Week 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Drop or impute columns with excessive missing values.

Convert datetime columns into proper formats.

Create new features like Hour, Weekday, or Month from timestamp.

Encode categorical variables if needed.

Handle outliers and duplicate entries.

Milestone 2
Week 3: Univariate Analysis

Analyze distribution of accident severity levels.

Plot accident frequency by time of day, day of the week, and month.

Examine most common weather conditions and road types during accidents.

Use histograms, pie charts, and bar graphs.

Week 4: Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Analyze correlation between severity and:

Weather conditions

Visibility

Road surface condition

Traffic congestion

Create heatmaps, boxplots, and pair plots to reveal relationships.

Milestone 3
Week 5: Geospatial and Location-Based Analysis

Visualize accident hotspots using latitude and longitude.

Create scatter plots or density maps for different states/cities.

Highlight top 5 most accident-prone states or cities.

Week 6: Insight Extraction and Hypothesis Testing

Answer key questions:

What time of day has the most accidents?

Are accidents more severe during rain or fog?

Is there a correlation between visibility and severity?

Document assumptions, test hypotheses, and summarize findings.

Milestone 4
Week 7: Final Visualization and Interpretation

Combine findings into readable summaries with plots.

Focus on clarity and storytelling using visuals.

Finalize all graphs and interpretations.

Week 8: Documentation and Presentation Preparation

Compile methodology, insights, and conclusions into a document.

Prepare a final presentation with charts and key takeaways.

Practice presenting insights and answering analytical questions.
